Widely used in knowledge-driven organizations, text mining is the process of examining large collections of documents to discover new information or help answer specific research questions.

Text mining identifies facts, relationships and assertions that would otherwise remain buried in the mass of textual big data. Once extracted, this information is converted into a structured form that can be further analyzed, or presented directly using clustered HTML tables, mind maps, charts, etc. Text mining employs a variety of methodologies to process the text, one of the most important of these being Natural Language Processing (NLP).

The structured data created by text mining can be integrated into databases, data warehouses or business intelligence dashboards and used for descriptive, prescriptive or predictive analytics.
